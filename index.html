                This study presents a computational model for analyzing musical tension in Electronic Dance Music (EDM)
                build-up sections through the lens of Gestalt principles. The proposed system extracts three key audio
                features: pitch proximity violation, timbral similarity violation, and temporal proximity increase to
                quantify the systematic violation of perceptual grouping principles that create tension in EDM
                build-ups. Using the YIN algorithm for pitch detection, spectral centroid analysis for timbral
                brightness, and inter-onset interval analysis for rhythmic density, the model computes a composite
                Tension Index that represents the perceptual buildup of energy over time. The implementation
                successfully demonstrates the feasibility of operationalizing Gestalt principles in computational music
                analysis, providing a foundation for understanding how violations of perceptual expectations create
                musical tension in dance music contexts.

                  The perceived need for
                  release, referred to as musical tension,
                  is a fundamental dynamic, which is especially
                  crucial and explicit in Electronic Dance Music (EDM).
                  The genre's primary goal is to elicit a powerful emotional
                  and physiological response on the dance floor,
                  which it achieves through the masterful manipulation
                  of tension and release.<br>
                  The quintessential structure of modern EDM centers
                  on the large-scale "build-up" and "drop" cycle.
                  The build-up is a dedicated section,
                  usually 8 to 16 bars, that systematically introduces
                  musical elements to heighten anticipation and intensity.
                  The subsequent drop provides the cathartic release as
                  the main beat and bassline return with full force.
                  The drop's perceived impact is not intrinsic. It is profoundly
                  magnified by the preceding build-up.<br>
                  Historically, this structure evolved from the continuous
                  grooves of early house and techno to the more pronounced
                  breakdowns of 1990s trance, which proved highly
                  effective in creating peak emotional experiences for large audiences.
                  <br>
                  Understanding why build-ups work requires a perceptual framework.
                  Music perception is not passive but an active organizational
                  process known as Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA),
                  which is governed by Gestalt principles.
                  Gestalt theory posits that the brain automatically
                  organizes sensory input into coherent "gestalts," or wholes.
                  The core principle, Prägnanz, is the brain's innate preference
                  for the simplest, most stable, and most orderly interpretation
                  of sensory data.
                  This relies on subsidiary principles, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Proximity: Grouping elements that are close in time or pitch.</li>
                  <li>Similarity: Grouping elements that share features like timbre or loudness.</li>
                  <li>Continuation: Perceiving elements that form a smooth line as a single entity.</li>
                </ul>
                This report argues that an EDM build-up creates tension
                by systematically and deliberately violating these principles.
                Production techniques actively work against the brain's
                tendency toward Prägnanz, forcing the perceptual system
                into a state of increasing instability and complexity.
                This resistance to simple grouping creates "perceptual strain."
                The subjective, emotional experience of rising tension is the
                direct correlate of the increasing cognitive effort
                required to parse a soundscape that actively
                defies the brain's fundamental organizational heuristics.

                    is directly correlated with the degree to

                  Musical tension is fundamentally rooted in expectation.
                  An EDM build-up purposefully establishes and then delays
                  an expected climactic event, known as the drop, thereby
                  increasing arousal. This psychological manipulation has a
                  clear neurochemical basis. The anticipation of the
                  drop triggers an initial dopamine release in the
                  brain's reward centers. The drop itself serves as the
                  powerful resolution that fulfills this chemically primed
                  expectation, resulting in a euphoric dopamine flood.
                  This effect is further amplified by contrastive
                  valence: the negative, tense state of the build-up
                  makes the subsequent positive release of the drop feel more potent.

                  Producers employ a standard toolkit to achieve this effect:
                <ul>
                  <li>Filtering: High-pass filter sweeps progressively remove low frequencies.</li>
                  <li>Rhythm: Accelerating snare rolls increase event density.</li>
                  <li>Pitch: Synthesized "risers" with continuously ascending pitch.</li>
                  <li>Techniques that include increasing reverb decay, momentary silences, or strategic volume drops
                    immediately before the drop to maximize its impact by contrast.</li>
                </ul>

                The computational modeling of musical tension is an active
                field in Music Information Retrieval (MIR).
                Research confirms that subjective tension can
                be accurately predicted by a weighted sum of
                musical features. State-of-the-art models like TenseMusic
                demonstrate this by tracking features like loudness,
                pitch, and tempo, as well as their rate of change (slope).
                The novelty of this project is not in its architecture
                (which adopts the established weighted-sum paradigm) but
                in its theoretical motivation. Rather than using an eclectic
                set of acoustic correlates, this project's features are
                chosen specifically to represent violations of a single,
                coherent psychological theory.
                This creates a conceptual paradox.
                Gestalt psychology is holistic
                ("the whole is different from the sum of its parts"),
                whereas a feature-based computational model is inherently
                reductionist ("the whole is the sum of its parts").
                This report acknowledges this paradox, presenting the model
                as a pragmatic engineering solution that uses a reductionist
                method to quantify the drivers of what is ultimately a
                holistic perceptual phenomenon.

                <p>
                  The development and analysis of the model were conducted on a curated corpus of audio material. The
                  corpus consists of 12 commercially produced EDM tracks selected from genres known for their prominent
                  and highly structured build-up sections, namely progressive house, bass house, techno, trance, and big
                  room house. The
                  selection criteria required each track to feature a clear and well-defined 8 or 16-bar build-up
                  leading into the main drop.
                  <br>
                  For each selected track, the build-up section was manually identified and edited into a separate audio
                  file. This
                  isolation ensures that the analysis focuses exclusively on the musical phenomena relevant to
                  tension-building, avoiding
                  confounding data from other sections of the arrangement.
                  <br>
                  Prior to feature extraction, all audio files underwent a standardized pre-processing pipeline
                  to ensure consistency and comparability. Each audio file is loaded using the
                  librosa library, converted to a monophonic signal, and resampled to a user-configurable sampling rate
                  (e.g., 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, or 48000 Hz). The audio was processed in short, overlapping frames. Key
                  analysis parameters, such as the STFT frame length (e.g., 2048 samples) and hop length (e.g., 256
                  samples), are user-configurable in the analysis tool.
                  <br>
                  The analysis was performed on
                  short, overlapping frames to create a time-series for each feature.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Pitch Proximity Violation (The "Riser"):</b><br>
                  This feature operationalizes the violation of pitch proximity, as
                  exemplified by the continuously ascending pitch of a synth riser.<br>
                  To track this rising pitch, the YIN fundamental frequency \(F_0\)
                  estimation algorithm was applied. This implementation
                  specifically targets the most stable tonal element by first applying a harmonic-percussive source
                  separation (HPSS) and running the YIN algorithm only on the resulting harmonic component of the
                  signal. The algorithm estimates \(F_0\) for each analysis frame. Unvoiced frames (those with low
                  periodicity) are set to 'Not a Number' (NaN) to be excluded from later calculations.<br>
                  The raw \(F_0\) time-series is first smoothed using a NaN-aware moving average filter with reflect
                  padding to reduce spurious fluctuations. The smoothed curve is then normalized.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Timbral Similarity Violation (The "Filter Sweep"):</b><br>
                  This feature quantifies the violation of timbral similarity caused by the
                  timbral brightening effect of a high-pass filter sweep.<br>
                  The Spectral Centroid was calculated for each audio frame using
                  <code>librosa.feature.spectral_centroid</code>. The spectral centroid is
                  defined as the "center of mass" of a signal's frequency spectrum. It is calculated as the weighted
                  mean of the frequencies present in the spectrum, where the magnitude of each frequency serves as its
                  weight.<br>
                  The formula is:$$C = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(n)x(n)}{\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n)}$$ where \(x(n)\)
                  is the magnitude of frequency bin \(n\), and \(f(n)\) is the center frequency of that bin.<br>
                  The spectral centroid has a strong and robust perceptual correlation with the
                  "brightness" of a sound. As a high-pass filter's cutoff frequency rises, it removes low-frequency
                  energy from the signal. This causes the spectrum's center of mass to shift upwards, resulting in a
                  corresponding increase in the spectral centroid value.<br>
                  Similar to the pitch feature,
                  the resulting time-series of spectral centroid values is smoothed using a NaN-aware moving average
                  filter before being normalized.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Temporal Proximity Violation (The "Snare Roll"):</b><br>
                  This feature models the increase in temporal proximity (or decrease in the
                  time between events) that characterizes rhythmic acceleration, such as a snare roll.<br>
                  The feature is calculated as the inverse of the Inter-Onset Interval (IOI) through a multi-step
                  process.
                  An onset detection function (<code>librosa.onset.onset_strength</code> followed by
                  <code>librosa.onset.onset_detect</code>) is applied to the audio signal to identify the precise time
                  points of
                  percussive events.
                  The time difference between each consecutive pair of detected
                  onsets is calculated, yielding a series of Inter-Onset Intervals (IOIs).<br>
                  The feature is computed as the inverse of the IOI: \(IOI^{-1}\).
                  To generate a continuous time-series, this
                  \(IOI^{-1}\) value is assigned to all analysis frames that fall within a symmetric time window (e.g.,
                  2.0 seconds, user-configurable) centered on the start of that \(IOI\). This creates a
                  step-function-like
                  series where the rhythmic density value is updated at each new onset.<br>
                  This step-function series is then smoothed with a NaN-aware moving average filter to blend the
                  discrete
                  changes, and finally normalized.

                  <br>
                <p>
                  The final output of the model is the Composite Tension Index, a single time-series, \(Tension(t)\),
                  that
                  represents the predicted overall tension at each moment in time. This index is generated by combining
                  the three feature streams. Before combination, each feature stream (pitch, centroid, IOI) is
                  independently normalized using a robust percentile-based method, scaling the 5th percentile to 0 and
                  the 95th percentile to 1. This prevents outlier values from dominating the feature's contribution. The
                  final index is computed as a NaN-aware weighted average, not a simple sum. The user provides weights
                  (\(w_1, w_2, w_3\)), which are first normalized to sum to 1. Then, for each time frame \(t\), the
                  model
                  calculates the tension as:
                  $$Tension(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \cdot F_{i, norm}(t)}{\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i \cdot M_i(t)}$$

                  where \(F_{i, norm}(t)\) is the normalized value of feature \(i\) at time \(t\), \(w_i\) is its normalized
                  weight, and \(M_i(t)\) is a mask that is 1 if the feature is valid (not NaN) at time \(t\) and 0
                  otherwise.
                  For the purposes of this project, the weights
                  were set to unity (\(w_1 = w_2 = w_3 = 1\)).
                  This simplification assumes an equal contribution from the
                  violation of each of the three Gestalt principles to
                  the overall perception of tension. The implications and
                  limitations of this assumption are explored in the Discussion
                  section of this report.
                  The final \(Tension(t)\) curve is then typically scaled
                  or normalized for clear visualization.</p>

                  section from the corpus is considered ("buildup06.mp3"). For this case study build-up, the time-series

                <strong>Pitch Proximity Violation (Smoothed \(F_0\)):</strong>
                The pitch trajectory demonstrates the highest variability of all features.
                The normalized pitch curve oscillates rapidly throughout the entire time span,
                with frequent alternations between low and high values.
                Such fluctuations suggest an unstable melodic structure or the presence of
                layered risers and harmonically modulated elements.
                Despite this variability, a general upward tendency emerges in the final
                seconds, where the pitch curve peaks at its maximum value at around 15 seconds.
                This final rise represents the culmination of pitch movement, the auditory
                manifestation of an ascending riser. Rather than a smooth linear ascent,
                the feature depicts a fragmented, tension-rich pattern marked by
                intermittent climbs and collapses. This behavior is consistent with
                production techniques that use pitch modulation, detuning, or gliding
                effects to maintain continuous anticipation and instability.

                    proximity violation.</i>
                </h4>



                <strong>Timbral Similarity Violation (Spectral Centroid):</strong>
                The spectral centroid trajectory exhibits a moderate level of fluctuation throughout
                the first half of the build-up, with alternating rises and drops that suggest subtle
                variations in brightness rather than a steady increase. Between 8 and 10 seconds,
                sharp, narrow peaks occur, brief bursts of high-frequency energy likely caused by
                transient or percussive elements accentuating the upper spectrum.
                Following these bursts, the centroid briefly stabilizes before undergoing a pronounced
                upward climb between 13 and 15 seconds, where it reaches its normalized maximum.
                This late-stage acceleration mirrors the auditory experience of a high-pass filter
                sweep, where progressively more low frequencies are removed as the build-up nears
                its climax, producing a perceptual sense of "opening" and intensifying brightness.
                The data confirm that timbral tension in this track is introduced gradually,
                punctuated by dynamic surges that contribute to moments of heightened instability before the final rise.

                </h4>

                <strong>Temporal Proximity Increase (\(IOI^{-1}\)):</strong>
                The inverse IOI curve presents a distinct rhythmic progression compared
                to the other features. Initially, the curve starts high, around 0.8–1.0,
                reflecting a dense rhythmic texture or rapid onsets at the start of
                the build-up. A steady decline follows, reaching near-zero values around 5–6 seconds,
                indicating rhythmic sparsity or a break in percussion. The feature then remains
                relatively stable at mid-range values (~0.4) through most of the middle section,
                before surging sharply again around 14 seconds to reach its maximum value.
                This trajectory indicates that rhythmic density fluctuates in
                structured phases: an early burst of percussive energy, a relaxed middle phase,
                and a rapid acceleration toward the end. The final sharp increase corresponds to
                the characteristic snare roll acceleration that typifies EDM build-ups.
                The results align with the theoretical premise that temporal proximity violation increases
                most strongly at the build-up’s final moments, contributing
                to the sense of urgency immediately preceding the drop.

                <h3 class="title is-4">Visualizing the Build-up Curve</h3>
                <p>
                  The figure 4. illustrates the output of the model's final stage, a continuous Composite Tension Index
                  calculated as the weighted sum of the normalized pitch, timbral, and rhythmic features over time.
                  The resulting curve captures the dynamic evolution of perceptual tension throughout the sixteen-second
                  build-up,
                  with values normalized between 0 (minimum tension) and 1 (maximum tension).

                  <i>Figure 4. Composite Tension Index over time.</i>
                </h4>

                <p>
                  The curve begins around a moderate tension level (~0.4) and remains relatively stable through the
                  first few seconds,
                  reflecting the perceptual stability of the early build-up phase where the rhythmic grid and timbral
                  content remain
                  consistent. Between 2 and 3 seconds, a slight drop in tension (~0.2) is observed, corresponding to a
                  brief sonic
                  thinning or reduced rhythmic density, a common production technique used to reset the perceptual
                  baseline.

                  From 3 to 9 seconds, the curve oscillates between 0.3–0.5, suggesting alternating minor violations of
                  Gestalt stability
                  through subtle timbral modulations or early filter movements. Around the 9–10 second mark, a
                  pronounced spike (~0.8)
                  emerges, indicating a moment of increased perceptual strain caused by the convergence of multiple
                  factors,often the
                  onset of a snare roll acceleration or intensified high-pass sweep.

                  After this peak, tension briefly subsides (0.3–0.4) before rising again, consistent with dynamic
                  micro-variations in the
                  build-up structure. From 12 seconds onward, a sustained and sharp increase dominates the curve,
                  culminating near 1.0 at
                  15–16 seconds. This final ascent represents the apex of perceptual instability and anticipatory
                  arousal where pitch,
                  timbre, and rhythm all intensify simultaneously before the imminent drop. The shape thus follows the
                  expected non-linear
                  “accelerating” curve theorized in the model: a relatively steady beginning, mid-level fluctuations,
                  and an exponential
                  climb toward maximum tension.

                <h3 class="title is-4">Comparative Analysis Across the EDM Corpus</h3>
                <p>
                  The model’s generalizability was evaluated across a corpus of twelve EDM build-up sections drawn from
                  various subgenres,
                  including progressive house, trance, and big room house. Each section was processed through the
                  feature-based system
                  previously described, producing a normalized Tension Index curve for each track. To enable direct
                  comparison,
                  all build-up durations were rescaled to a common temporal axis representing 0–100% of progression
                  time, ensuring
                  structural alignment despite differing bar lengths (8 or 16 bars).

                <p>
                  While the specific shape and steepness of the tension curves are expected to vary between
                  tracks, a consistent overarching pattern of monotonically increasing tension should be evident
                  across the entire catalogue. This would provide evidence for the model's validity as a
                  general descriptor of the build-up process within the selected EDM genres. Any observable
                  differences can be meaningfully interpreted in the context of sub-genre conventions. For
                  example, a classic trance build-up might exhibit a longer, more linear, and gradual tension
                  slope, whereas a big room house build-up might be characterized by a shorter, more
                  explosive, and exponentially shaped curve. Such analysis demonstrates the model's potential
                  not only for confirming a general effect but also for quantifying stylistic differences in musical
                  structure.

                  The results generated by the model, particularly the consistent, accelerating arc of the Composite
                  Tension Index, support the project's central hypothesis. The rising index can be interpreted as more
                  than a simple description of acoustic signal properties. It represents a quantitative model of a
                  listener's underlying perceptual and cognitive state during the build-up. The model provides an
                  objective correlate to the subjective experience of mounting excitement and anticipation.
                  <br>
                  This interpretation is grounded in the Gestalt framework that motivated the model's design. The
                  increasing Tension Index reflects the escalating "perceptual strain" placed upon the auditory system.
                  As the synth riser violates pitch proximity, the filter sweep violates timbral similarity, and the
                  snare roll violates temporal proximity, the brain must expend increasing cognitive resources to parse
                  an auditory scene that is actively resisting its innate organizational heuristics. The peak of the
                  tension curve represents the point of maximum perceptual instability, the moment where the need for
                  resolution, for a return to a stable, predictable perceptual state, is at its highest. The subsequent
                  drop provides this resolution, collapsing the accumulated perceptual complexity back into a stable,
                  rhythmically grounded pattern, thereby generating the powerful cathartic release that is the hallmark
                  of the EDM experience.

                <p>
                <h5><b>Limitations</b></h5>
                Two main limitations constrain the model’s precision. First, rhythmic tension is simplified to the
                inverse Inter-Onset Interval, which captures acceleration but overlooks higher order structures like
                syncopation or microtiming. Second, all features were equally weighted, an assumption unlikely to
                match real perceptual salience. Future refinements should apply regression based weighting from
                listener data and integrate features such as loudness, roughness, or harmonic dissonance.
